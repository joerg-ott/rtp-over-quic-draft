RTCP packets within QUIC.  It also discusses how to leverage state
from the QUIC implementation in the endpoints to reduce the exchange
of RTCP packets.

# Introduction

The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) {{!RFC3550}} is generally used
to carry real-time media for conversational media sessions, such as
video conferences, across the Internet.  Since RTP requires real-time
delivery and is tolerant to packet losses, the default underlying
transport protocol has been UDP, recently with DTLS on top to secure
the media exchange and occasionallly TCP (and possibly TLS) as
fallback.  With the advent of QUIC and, most notably, its unreliable
DATAGRAM extension, another secure transport protocol becomes
avaialble.  QUIC and its DATAGRAMs combine desirable properties for
real-time traffic (e.g., no unnecessary retransmissions, avoiding
head-of-line blocking) with a secure end-to-end transport that is
also expected to work well through NATs and firewalls.

Moreover, with QUIC's multiplexing capabilities, reliable and
unreliable transport connections as, e.g., needed for WebRTC, can be
established with only a single port used at either end of the
connection.  This document defines a mapping of how to carry RTP over
QUIC.  The focus is on RTP and RTCP packet mapping and on reducing the
amount of RTCP traffic by leveraging state information readily
available within a QUIC endpoint.  This document also briefly touches
upon how to signal media over QUIC using the Session Description
Protocol (SDP) {{!RFC4566}}.

The scope of this document is limited to unicast RTP/RTCP.

Note that this draft is similar in spirit to but differs in numerous ways from
{{QRT}}.


# Terminology and Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

The following terms are used:

Congestion Controller:
: QUIC specifies a congestion controller in {{Section 7 of QUIC-RECOVERY}} but the specific
requirements for interactive real-time media, lead to the development of dedicated congestion
control algorithms. The term congestion controller in this document refers to these alorithms which
are dedicated to real-time applications and may be used next to or instead of the congestion
controller specified by {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}.

Datagram:
: Datagrams exist in UDP as well as in QUICs unreliable datagram extension. If not explicitly noted
differently, the term datagram in this document refers to a QUIC Datagram as defined in
{{QUIC-DATAGRAM}}.

Endpoint:
: A QUIC server or client that participates in a RTP over QUIC session.

Frame:
: A QUIC frame as defined in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

Media Encoder:
: An entity that is used by an application to produce a stream of encoded media, which can be
packetized in RTP packets to be transmitted over QUIC.

Receiver:
: An endpoint that receives media in RTP packets and may send or receive RTCP packets.

Sender:
: An endpoint sends media in RTP packets and may send or receive RTCP packets.

Packet diagrams in this document use the format defined in {{Section 1.3 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}} to
illustrate the order and size of fields.

# Protocol Overview

This document introduces a mapping of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to the QUIC transport
protocol. QUIC supports two transport methods: reliable streams and unreliable datagrams
{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, {{QUIC-DATAGRAM}}. RTP over QUIC uses unreliable QUIC datagrams to transport
real-time data.

{{!RFC3550}} specifies that RTP sessions need to be transmitted on different transport addresses to
allow multiplexing between them. RTP over QUIC uses a different approach, in order to leverage the
advantages of QUIC connections without managing a separate QUIC connection per RTP session. QUIC
does not provide demultiplexing between different flows on datagrams, but suggests that an
application implements a demultiplexing mechanism if it is required. An example of such a mechanism
are flow identifiers prepended to each datagram frame as described in {{H3-DATAGRAM}}. RTP over QUIC
uses a flow identifier as a replacement for network address and port number, to multiplex many RTP
sessions over the same QUIC connection.

A congestion controller can be plugged in, to adapt the media bitrate to the available bandwidth.
This document does not mandate any congestion control algorithm, some examples include
Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) {{!RFC8698}} and Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation for
Multimedia (SCReAM) {{!RFC8298}}. These congestion control algorithms require some feedback about
the performance of the network in order to calculate target bitrates. Traditionally this feedback is
generated at the receiver and sent back to the sender via RTCP. Since QUIC also collects some
metrics about the networks performance, these metrics can be used to generate the required feedback
at the sender-side and provide it to the congestion controller, to avoid the additional overhead of
the RTCP stream.

> **Editor's note:** Should the congestion controller work independently from the congestion
> controller used in QUIC, because the QUIC connection can simultaneously be used for other data
> streams, that need to be congestion controlled, too?

# Local Interfaces

RTP over QUIC requires different components like QUIC implementations, congestion controllers and
media encoders to work together. The interfaces of these components have to fulfill certain
requirements which are described in this section.

## QUIC Interface

If the used QUIC implementation is not directly incorporated into the RTP over QUIC mapping
implementation, it has to fulfill the following interface requirements. The QUIC implementation MUST
support QUICs unreliable datagram extension and it MUST provide a way to signal acknowledgements or
losses of QUIC datagrams to the application. Since datagram frames cannot be fragmented, the QUIC
implementation MUST provide a way to query the maximum datagram size, so that an application can
create RTP packets that always fit into a QUIC datagram frame.

Additionally, a QUIC implementation MUST expose the recorded RTT statistics as described in
{{Section 5 of QUIC-RECOVERY}} to the application. These statistics include the minium observed RTT
over a period of time (`min_rtt`), exponentially-weighted moving average (`smoothed_rtt`) and the mean
deviation (`rtt_var`). These values are necessary to perform congestion control as explained in
{{cc-interface}}.

{{Section 7.1 of QUIC-RECOVERY}} also specifies how QUIC treats Explicit Congestion Notifications
(ECN) if it is supported by the network path. If ECN counts can be exported from a QUIC
implementation, these may be used to improve congestion control, too.

## Congestion Controller Interface {#cc-interface}

There are different congestion control algorithms proposed by RMCAT to implement application layer
congestion control for real-time communications. To estimate the currently available bandwidth,
these algorithms keep track of the sent packets and typically require a list of successfully
delivered packets together with the timestamps at which they were received by a receiver. The
bandwidth estimation can then be used to decide, whether the media encoder can be configured to
produce output at a higher or lower rate.

A congestion controller used for RTP over QUIC should be able to compute an adequate bandwidth
estimation using the following inputs:

* `t_current`: A current timestamp
* `pkt_status_list`: A list of RTP packets that were acknowledged by the receiver
* `pkt_delay_list`: For each acknowledged RTP packet, a delay between the sent- and
  receive-timestamps of the packet
* The RTT estimations calculated by QUIC as described in {{Section 5 of QUIC-RECOVERY}}:
  * `min_rtt`: The miminum RTT observed by QUIC over a period of time
  * `smoothed_rtt`: An exponentially-weighted moving average of the observed RTT values
  * `rtt_var`: The mean deviation in the observed RTT values
* `ecn`: Optionally ECN marks may be used, if supported by the network and exposed by the QUIC
  implementation.

A congestion controller MUST expose a `target_bitrate` to which the encoder should be configured to
fully utilize the available bandwidth.

It is assumed that the congestion controller provides a pacing mechanism to determine when a packet
can be send and to avoid bursts. All of the currently proposed congestion control algorithms for
real-time communications provide such a pacing mechanism. The use of congestion controllers which
don't provide a pacing mechanism is out of scope of this document.

## Codec Interface {#encoder-interface}

An application is expected to adapt the media bitrate to the observed available bandwidth by setting
the media encoder to the `target_bitrate` that is computed by the congestion controller. Thus, the
media encoder needs to offer a way to update its bitrate accordingly. A RTP over QUIC implementation
can either expose the most recent `target_bitrate` produced by the congestion controller to the
application, or accept a callback from the application, which updates the encoder bitrate whenever
the congestion controller updates the `target_bitrate`.

# Packet Format {#packet-format}

All RTP packets MUST be sent in QUIC datagram frames with the following format:

~~~
Datagram Payload {
  Flow Identifier (i),
  RTP/RTCP Packet (..)
}
~~~
{: #fig-datagram-payload title="Datagram Payload Format"}

For multiplexing RTP sessions on the same QUIC connection, each RTP/RTCP packet is prefixed with a
flow identifier. This flow identifier serves as a replacement for using different transport
addresses per session. A flow identifier is a QUIC variable length integer which must be unique per
stream.

RTP and RTCP packets of a single RTP session MAY be sent using the same flow identifier (following
the procedures defined in {{!RFC5761}}, or they MAY be sent using different flow identifiers.
The respective mode of operation MUST be indicated using the appropriate signaling, e.g.,
when using SDP as discussed in {{sdp}}.

RTP and RTCP packets of different RTP sessions MUST be sent using different flow identifiers.

Differentiating RTP/RTCP datagrams of different RTP sessions from non-RTP/RTCP datagrams is
the responsibility of the application by means of appropriate use of flow identifiers and
the corresponding signaling.

RTP senders SHOULD consider the header overhead associated with QUIC datagrams and ensure that
the RTP/RTCP packets including their payloads, QUIC, and IP headers will fit into path MTU.

# Protocol Operation {#protocol-operation}

This section describes how senders and receivers can exchange RTP packets using QUIC. While the
receiver side is very simple, the sender side has to keep track of sent packets and corresponding
acknowledgements to implement congestion control.

RTP/RTCP packets that are submitted to an RTP over QUIC implementation are buffered in a queue. The
congestion controller defines the rate at which the next packet is dequeued and sent over the QUIC
connection. Before a packet is sent, it is prefixed with the flow identifier described in
{{packet-format}} and encapsulated in a QUIC datagram.

The implementation has to keep track of sent RTP packets in order to build the feedback for a congestion
controller described in {{cc-interface}}. Each sent RTP packet is mapped to the datagram in which it was
sent over QUIC. When the QUIC implementation signals an acknowledgement for a specific datagram, the
packet that was sent in this datagram is marked as received. Together with the received mark, an
estimation of the delay at which the packet was received by the peer can be stored. Assuming the RTT
is divided equally between the link from the sender to the receiver and the link back to the sender,
this estimation can be calculated using the RTT exposed by QUIC divided by two. This mapping can
later be used to create the `pkt_status_list` and the `pkt_delay_list` as described in
{{cc-interface}}.

In a regular interval, the `pkt_status_list` and the `pkt_delay_list` MUST be passed to the
congestion controller together with the current timestamp `t_current` and the RTT statistics
`min_rtt`, `smoothed_rtt` and `rtt_var`. If available, the feedback MAY also contain the ECN marks.

The feedback report can be passed to the congestion controller at a frequency
specified by the used algorithm.

The congestion controller regularly outputs the `target_bitrate`, which is forwarded to the encoder
using the interface described in {{encoder-interface}}.

{: #fig-send-flow title="RTP over QUIC send flow"}

On receiving a datagram, an RTP over QUIC implementation strips off and parses the flow identifier to
identify the stream to which the received RTP packet belongs. The remaining content of the datagram
is then passed to the RTP session which was assigned the given flow identifier.

# SDP Signalling {#sdp}

QUIC is a connection-based protocol that supports connectionless transmissions of DATAGRAM frames
within an established connection.  As noted above, demultiplexing DATAGRAMS intended for different
purposes is up to the application using QUIC.

There are several necessary steps to carry out jointly between the
communicating peers to enable RTP over QUIC:

0. The protocol identifier for the m= lines MUST be "QUIC/RTP", combined as per {{!RFC4566}}
   with the respective audiovisual profile: for example, "QUIC/RTP/AVP".

1. The peers need to decide whether to establish a new QUIC connection or whether to re-use an
   existing one.  In case of establishing a new connection, the initiator and the responder
   (client and server) need to be determined.  Signaling for this step MUST follow {{!RFC8122}}
   on SDP attributes for connection-oriented media for the a=setup, a=connection, and
   a=fingerprint attributes.  They MUST use the appropriate protocol identification as per 1.

2. The peers must provide a means for identifying RTP sessions carried in QUIC DATAGRAMS.
   To enable using a common transport connection for one, two, or more media sessions in
   the first place, the BUNDLE grouping framework MUST be used {{!RFC8843}}.  All media sections
   belonging to a bundle group, except the first one, MUST set the port in the m= line to zero
   and MUST include the a=bundle-only attribute.

   For disambiguating different RTP session, a reference needs to be provided for each m= line to
   allow associating this specific media session with a flow identifier.  This could be
   achieved following different approaches:

   * Simply reusing the a=extmap attribute {{!RFC8285}} and relying on RTP header extensions
     for demultiplexing different media packets carried in QUIC DATAGRAM frames.

   * Defining a variant or different flavor of the a=extmap attribute {{!RFC8285}} that binds
     media sessions to flow identifiers used in QUIC DATAGRAMS.

   > **Editor's note:** It is likely preferable to use multiplexing using QUIC DATAGRAM flow
   identifiers because this multiplexing mechanisms will also work across RTP and non-RTP media
   streams.

   In either case, the corresponding identifiers MUST be treated independently for each
   direction of transmission, so that an endpoint MAY choose its own identifies and only
   uses SDP to inform its peer which RTP sessions use which identifiers.

   To this end, SDP MUST be used to indicate the repsective flow identifiers for RTP and RTCP
   of the different RTP sessions (for which we borrow inspiration from {{!RFC3605}}).

3. The peers MUST agree, for each RTP session, whether or not to apply RTP/RTCP multiplexing.
   If multiplexing RTP and RTCP shall take place on the same flow identifier, this MUST be
   indicated using the attribute a=rtcp-mux.

A sample session setup offer (liberally borrowed and extended from {{!RFC8843}} and {{!RFC8122}}
could look as follows:

# Used RTP/RTCP packet types

Any RTP packet can be sent over QUIC and no RTCP packets are used by default. Since QUIC already
includes some features which are usually implemented by certain RTCP messages, RTP over QUIC
implementations should not need to implement the following RTCP messages:

* PT=205, FMT=1, Name=Generic NACK: Provides Negative Acknowledgements {{!RFC4585}}. Acknowledgement
  and loss notifications are already provided by the QUIC connection.
* PT=205, FMT=8, Name=RTCP-ECN-FB: Provides RTCP ECN Feedback {{!RFC6679}}. If supported, ECN
  may directly be exposed by the used QUIC implementation.
* PT=205, FMT=11, Name=CCFB: RTP Congestion Control Feedback which contains receive marks,
  timestamps and ECN notifications for each received packet {{!RFC8888}}. This can be inferred from
  QUIC as described in {{protocol-operation}}.
* PT=210, FMT=all, Name=Token, {{!RFC6284}} specifies a way to dynamically assign ports for RTP
  receivers. Since QUIC connections manage ports on their own, this is not required for RTP over
  QUIC.

# Enhancements

The RTT statistics collected by QUIC may not be very precise because it can be influenced by delayed
ACKs. An alternative the RTT is to explicitly measure a one way delay. {{QUIC-TS}} suggests an
extension for QUIC to implement one way delay measurements using a timestamp carried in a special
QUIC frame. The new frame carries the time at which a packet was sent. This timestamp can be used by
the receiver to estimate a one way delay as the difference between the time at which a packet was
received and the timestamp in the received packet. The one way delay can then be used as a
replacement for the receive time estimation derived from the RTT as described in
{{protocol-operation}} to create the `pkt_delay_list`.

> **Editor's note:** Even with one-way delay measurements it is still not possible to identify exact
> timestamps for individual packets, since the timestamp may be sent with an ACK that acks more than
> one earlier packet.
